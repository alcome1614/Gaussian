# A gentle introduction to Variational Inference

We introduce the concept of variational inference and we apply it to a practical case: systems of mixed gaussians.

The file `report.pdf` explains this concept and presents the experiments carried on. The notebook `code.ipynb` contains the experiments carried on.
